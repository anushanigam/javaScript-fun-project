# javaScript-fun-project
 
This repo contains my javaScript projects:
1. Color-Game -> A fun RGB color guessing game.
2. Todo-App -> A web app where you can create your daily todo list and can mark the tasks completed or could simply delete them.
3. PataTap clone -> An app where with the touch of a finger you can create melodies charged with moving shapes. I made this using js libraries(paper.js and howler.js).
